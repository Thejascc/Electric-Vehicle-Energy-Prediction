# Energy Consumption Analysis for Electric Vehicles

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and model the energy consumption of electric vehicles (EVs) based on various trip features such as trip distance, speed, and other relevant parameters. The dataset includes driving records for private electric cars (Roewe E50) collected between June 5, 2015, and June 30, 2016, with a sampling frequency of one minute. The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors influencing energy consumption and build predictive models to estimate energy consumption for future trips.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of several columns, including:

- **Trip Energy Consumption**: Energy consumed during a trip.
- **Trip Distance**: Distance covered during the trip.
- **Speed**: Speed of the vehicle during the trip.
- **Time**: Timestamp of each trip.
- **Battery Cell Temperature**: Temperature readings from the vehicle's battery.
- **Other features**: Additional sensor readings related to the vehicle's performance.
